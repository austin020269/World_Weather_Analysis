## Analysis/Workflow/Output

Deliverable 1 (code : https://github.com/austin020269/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.ipynb)
Our code was used to create a spreadsheet containing cities and their current weather information including: 
- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Percent humidity
- Percent cloudiness
- Wind speed
- Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)

Deliverable 2 (code : https://github.com/austin020269/World_Weather_Analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/Vacation_Search.ipynb)
We used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.  The search was run according to the answers as follows :

1. What is the minimum temperature you would like for your trip? 0
2. What is the maximum temperature you would like for your trip? 100

- The filter the dataframe according to the answers from 1 and 2.
